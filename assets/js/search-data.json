Example (Mixed $p$-spin models). $ quad$ Let $ Sigma_N$ denote either the hypercube $ { pm 1 }^N$ or the sphere . $$ mathbb{S}_N triangleq { x in mathbb{R}^N : | x |^2 = N }, $$which contains the hypercube. Let $( beta_p)_{p geq 1}$ be a sequence of non-negative numbers, and we suppose . $$ sum_{p geq 1} beta_p^2 &lt; infty . $$Given such a sequence, we define the model function $ xi : mathbb{R} to mathbb{R}$ via . $$ xi(x) triangleq sum_{p geq 1} beta_p^2 x^p $$as well as the associated Hamiltonian $H_N : mathbb{S}_N to mathbb{R}$, where for $s in mathbb{S}$, . $$ H_N(s) := sum_{p geq 1} beta_p N^{- (p-1)/2} sum_{ i_1, dots, i_p } g_{i_1, dots, i_p} s_{i_1} cdot dots cdot s_{i_p}, $$where the $g_{i_1, dots, i_p}$ are i.i.d. standard normal random variables. The model function and the associated Hamiltonian constitute the mixed $p$-spin model associated to $( beta_p)$. . The Hamiltonian is a random function on $ mathbb{S}_N$; the model coefficients $ beta_p$ are taken to be square-summable to ensure that the object $H_N$ is a.s. smooth. . The covariance structure of $H_N$ is a function of the sphere&#39;s geometry: letting $ langle cdot, cdot rangle$ denote the Euclidean inner product, . $$ mathbb{E} H_N (s) H_N(t) = N xi left( N^{-1} langle s , t rangle right) $$ .

We suppress the dependence of $ mu_{N, beta}$ on the model function $ xi$. . The Gibbs measure $ mu_{N, beta}$ is thus a random probability measure on the state space $ Sigma_N$. . When $ Sigma_N = mathbb{S}_N$ let us conflate the Gibbs measure $ mathcal{G}_{N, beta}$ with the density which defines it, notationally.
