The first notebook below describes and builds up to the geometric deep learning (GDL) blueprint outlined [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478). GDL is a relatively new perspective on neural network design based on data symmetries, and it felt important to understand for two reasons:

1. Building blocks of the most successful language and vision architectures are instances of the GDL blueprint for distinct symmetry groups.

2. The blueprint is a way to generate new architectures whenever data with additional or novel symmetry is encountered. 

I have built up to the GDL blueprint in a way that feels natural to me, but in general both notebooks below are still a work in progress and may be restructured. The goal of the second notebook is to clearly describe PyTorch implementations of the simplest instances of the GDL blueprint. While the first notebook is almost complete, the second is very much a work in progress. Eventually I will try to work in examples from the [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.
